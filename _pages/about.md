Hi, I'm Kiran. I'm an AI/ML scientist, engineer, and manager with 9 years of experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning, specializing in video/image-based deep learning, surgical AI, vision language reasoning systems, and reinforcement learning. I also have academic training in ethology, computational neuroscience, biomedical optics, and religious studies-so I've definitely taken the "scenic route" to where I am today. 

I'm drawn to difficult problem and concept spaces that require multi-disciplinary approaches and thoughtful consideration. However, I bias towards action and learn through building and making. 

Skilled in Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Transformers (Hugging Face), Scikit-Learn with extensive experience in healthcare settings and handling sensitive data (PHI/HIPAA). Proven track record of solving high-impact problems by developing 0 $\rightarrow$ 1 solutions, taking ML models from R\&D to production while managing ML teams. Experienced in traditional ML and data science along with video-based deep learning models, as well as, LLM and vision-LM based systems. Author of patents and publications, eager to build AI and drive impactful solutions across market sectors.
