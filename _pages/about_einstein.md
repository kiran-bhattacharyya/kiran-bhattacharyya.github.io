Hi, I'm Kiran. I'm an AI/ML scientist, engineer, and manager with 9 years of experience in artificial intelligence and machine learning, specializing in video/image-based deep learning, surgical AI, vision language reasoning systems, and reinforcement learning. I also have academic training in ethology, computational neuroscience, biomedical optics, and religious studies-so I've definitely taken the "scenic route" to where I am today. 

I'm drawn to difficult problem and concept spaces that require multi-disciplinary approaches and thoughtful consideration. However, I bias towards action and learn through building and making. Recently, I've been focused on developing machine learning and AI systems starting from R\&D and deploying into production to address some of the most pressing challenges in healthcare, including medical image analysis, computer-aided diagnosis, and personalized medicine. 

Check out what I've been up to and some of my projects [here](/projects). Feel free to reach out!
